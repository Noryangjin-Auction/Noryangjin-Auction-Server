# Analysis

The test requirement asks for a `UserRepository` that extends `JpaRepository`. This is a standard Spring Data JPA repository interface.

**Files needed:**
1. `UserRepository.java` - The repository interface
2. `User.java` - The entity (assuming it exists, but I should verify)

Since this is creating a new repository file and might need to reference the User entity, I'll use **Multi-File format**.

However, looking at the core domain mentioned in the context (`User`, `Product`, `AuctionEvent`, `AuctionItem`), the `User` entity should already exist.

**Decision:** Single new file needed - `UserRepository.java`

But since we're creating a new file, we should use **Multi-File format** even for one file to be consistent.

# Implementation

```
===FILE_BOUNDARY===
path: src/main/java/com/noryangjin/auction/server/domain/user/UserRepository.java
```java
package com.noryangjin.auction.server.domain.user;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
```
```

# Self-Check

1. ✅ Analyzed what files needed? - Yes, only UserRepository
2. ✅ Creating all necessary files? - Yes, just the repository
3. ✅ Output format correct? - Yes, Multi-File for new file
4. ✅ Will this compile? - Yes, extends JpaRepository with User entity and Long ID
5. ✅ Meets requirement? - Yes, extends JpaRepository as specified
6. ✅ Simplest solution? - Yes, empty interface with proper generic types
